-Understand and identify SQL injection vulnerabilities

-Exploit stacked queries to turn SQL injection into remote code execution



# SQL
Essential for working with relational databases and building dynamic websites.
Used for checking bank account balance, browsing products on e-commerce sites,
posting on social media---all of these activities indirectly query and alter
databases. 

Relational databases are structured data collections organized into tables,
each consisting of various rows and columns. Within these collections, tables
are interconnected with predefined relationships, facilitating efficient data
organization retrieval. For example, an e-commerce relational database might
include tables for "customers", "orders", and "products" with relationships
defined to link customer information to their respective orders through the
use of identifiers.

SQL provides a rigid way to query, insert, update, and delete the data stored
in these tables, allowing you to retrieve and alter databases as needed. A
website or application that relies on a database must dynamically generate SQL
queries and send them to the database engine to fetch or update the necessary
data. The syntax of SQL queries is based on English and consists of structured
commands using keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN to express
operations in a natural, language-like way. 


# EXAMPLE SQL COMMANDS

# Return all columns for the ornaments for which the material is wood
SELECT * FROM tbl_ornaments WHERE material = 'Wood';

# Return all the ornaments created by the elf with the ID 102; however it only
# returns the ornament's ID, color, and category
SELECT ornament_id, color, category FROM tbl_ornaments WHERE eld_id = 102;

# Adds a new ornament to the table created by the elf with the ID 105 and the
# specified values for each column
INSERT INTO tbl_ornaments (ornament_id, elf_id, color, category, material,
date_created, price) VALUES (5, 105, 'Blue', 'Star', 'Glass', '2023-12-10',
4.99);



# PHP
General-purpose scripting language that plays a crucial role in web
development. Enables developers to create dynamic and interactive websites by
generating HTML content on the server and delivering it to the client's web
browser. PHP's versatility and seamless integration with SQL databses makes it
a powerful tool for building feature-rich, dynamic web applications. 

PHP is a server-side scripting language, meaning the code is executed on the
webserver before the final HTML is sent to the user's browser. Unlike client-
side technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; PHP allows developers to
perform various server-side tasks, such as connecting to a wide range of
databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server); executing SQL
queries, processing form data, and dynamically generating web content.

The most common way for PHP to connect to SQL databases is using the PHP Data
Objects (PDO) extension or specific database server drivers like mysqli for
MySQL or sqlsrv for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL). The connection is typically
established by providing parameters such as the host, username, password, and
database name. 

After establishing a database connection, we can execute SQL queries through
PHP and dynamically generate HTML content based on the returned data to
display information such as user profiles, product listings, or blog articles.

# PHP EXAMPLE COMMANDS

# Fetch information about any green-colored ornaments

// Execute an SQL query

// Save our SQL query to the variable, $query
$query = "SELECT * FROM tbl_ornaments WHERE color = 'Green'";

// Assign the function sql_srv_query() to the variable, $result
$result = sqlsrv_query($conn, $query); // $conn is the database connection
                                       // object;
                                       // we can use $result throughout the
                                       // script to fetch and display data;

-"The real power of database-drive webapps lies in making the queries dynamic.
In the previous example, we hardcoded the query to fetch green ornaments,
however real-world applications often require users to interact with the data.
For example, if we want to allow users to search for ornaments of their
choice, we need to create dynamic queries that can be adjusted based on user
input.
 
One common way to take in user-supplied data in webapps is through GET para-
meters. These parameters are typically appended to the URL
