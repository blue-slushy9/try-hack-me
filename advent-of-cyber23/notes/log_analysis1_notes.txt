# Jupyter Notebooks
Contain code, text, and each cell acts as its own terminal/interpreter. The
individual cells can be executed one at a time, step by step. 

*My issue during the exercise is that I was running only one cell at a time,
when I should have run all of them sequentially (double arrow button in tool-
bar, there is no keyboard shortcut). 

# Pandas
Python library used to manipulate, process, and structure data. Has to be
imported, e.g. "import pandas", often "import as pd". 

Series: pandas data structure similar a single column in a table, uses key-
value pairs. 

Dataframes: grouping of series'.

# Matplotlib
Allows for quick creation of many types of plots, e.g. bar charts, histograms,
pir charts, etc. 

pyplot: create first line chart (in this example).
