# CRUNCH
Open-source tool for generating potential passwords. 

"crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt"

3 = minimum length of password

3 = maximum length of password

0123456789ABCDEF = all possible characters in password

-o 3digits.txt = export output to a text file with the name 3digits.txt


# HYDRA
Open-source tool for performing brute-force attacks. 

hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v <TARGET-IP> http-post-form "/login.php:^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000

-l '' = login name is blank, otherwise the name would inside the quotes

-P 3digits.txt = specifies file that contains password list Hydra will use

-f = stops Hydra after finding a working password

-v = verbose, provides additional details of Hydra actions and errors

http-post-form = specifies the HTTP method to use, in this case POST

"/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" =

/login.php = webpage to which PIN gets submitted

pin=^PASS^ = will replace ^PASS^ with values from our password list

Acess denied = indicates invalid attempts will lead to a page that contains
the words "Access denied"

-s 8000 = indicates the (session) port number on the target


# VIEW PAGE SOURCE
Setting in web browsers that allows you to view the source code for a given
webpage. In this case, we needed the method, POST; the URL for the login page,
/login.php; and the name of the input value, pin. We then feed this
information to Hydra via the command above.

*If we have the file with the password hashes, we can perform offline attacks.
