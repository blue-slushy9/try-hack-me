# CeWL 
Custom wordlist generator that spiders websites to create lists based on the
site's content. "Spidering" means to automatically navigate and catalogue a
website, often to retrieve the site structure, content, etc. It can also
compile lists of email addresses and/or usernames found in team members' page
links. While its primary purpose is wordlist generation, CeWL includes functionalities such as username enumeration from author meta tags and email extraction.

    # Basic CeWL wordlist (can also be https or domain name)
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP>

    # Output to a text file
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP> -w output.txt

    # Spidering depth of 2 layers/links 
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP> -d 2 -w output1.txt

    # Minimum word length of 5, maximum word length of 10
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP> -m 5 -x 10 -w output2.txt

    # Append numbers to words
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP> --with-numbers 

    # Append custom extensions to words
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP> --extension

    # Spider to external sites (CeWL doesn't do this by default)
    cewl http://<TARGET-IP> --offsite


# WFUZZ
Tool for brute-forcing webapps, can be used to find resources not linked, e.g.
directories, servlets, scripts, etc. It can also brute-force GET and POST
parameters for checking different kinds of injections (SQL, XSS, LDAP). It can
brute-force forms parameters (user/password) and can do fuzzing.

    # EXAMPLE WFUZZ COMMAND
    wfuzz -c -z file,usernames.txt -z file,passwords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct
    credentials" -u http://<TARGET-IP>/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"

    -c = no argument, WFUZZ will default to a single connection to webserver

    -z = loads a file into wfuzz, which it will use in its brute-force attack

    --hs = hides responses containing the string, i.e. unsuccessful attempts

    -u = specifies the target URL

    -d = provides the POST data format where FUZZ will be replaced by
         usernames and FUZ2Z by passwords
