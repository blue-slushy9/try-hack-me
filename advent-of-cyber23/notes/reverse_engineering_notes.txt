# FILE SIGNATURES 
AKA "magic bytes", specific byte sequences at the beginning of a file that
identify or verify its content type and format. These bytes often have
corresponding ASCII characters. In cybersec, file signatures are crucial for
identifying file types and formats. Knowing these magic bytes can help you
to quickly identify malicious or suspicious files and choose the right tools
for analysis.

# BORLAND TURBO C COMPILER
Used to compile C code into a DOS executable.

    # COMPILE COMMAND
    TC HELLO.C # Then press ALT+C to open Compile menu, then select "Build All"

    # EXIT TURBO C by going to "File > Quit", you should now see a new file
    
# OPEN NEW EXECUTABLE IN EDIT MODE
EDIT HELLO.EXE # First two bytes, MZ, are the magic bytes which denote a DOS 
executable

# REOPEN AC2023.BAK IN EDIT MODE
EDIT C:\AC2023.BAK # You should see the magic bytes set to "XX"; however
BUMASTER.EXE expects the magic bytes to be "41 43", ergo we will convert the
HEX value of "41 43" to ASCII in order to reinsert the correct value into the
magic bytes field

    # HEX TO ASCII CONVERTER

    # CORRECT MAGIC BYTES
    AC # According to the converter, the magic bytes are "AC", so we use 
    EDIT MODE to insert this value into our AC2023.BAK file; now just save
    the
    changes and you should be able to restore the backup and view the flag!
