-eXtensible Markup Language (XML): commonly used method to transport and store
data in a structured format that humans and machines can easily understand. 

Example: two computers need to agree on a common format for exchanging
information, the XML would be the format to which they both agree. This is why
XML uses tags to label and organize information.

-Document Type Definition (DTD): a set of rules that defines the structure of
the XML document. It acts like a database scheme or blueprint, telling you what
elements (tags) and attributes are allowed in the XML file.

-XML eXternal Entity (XXE): attack that exploits how XML parsers handle external
entities. When a webapp processes an XML file that contains an external entity,
the parser attempts to load or execute whatever resource the entity points to.
If necessary sanitation is not in place, the attacker may point the entity to
any malicious source/code causing the undesired behavior of the webapp.

-POST: HTTP method used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.
Unlike GET requests, which send data in the URL as query parameters, POST
requests send data in the request body. This makes them suitable for sending
larger amounts of data, including binary data like file uploads.

The data sent in a POST request is not visible in the browser address bar, 
making it more suitable for sensitive data like passwords or form submissions 
that modify data on the server.

POST is typically used for actions that have side effects on the server, 
e.g. submitting a form, uploading files, creating new database resources, 
making changes to server-side data.

-Asynchronous Javascript And XML (AJAX): a set of webdev techniques used to
create interactive webapps that can update parts of a webpage without requiring
a full page reload. Although the name includes "XML", JSON (JavaScript Object 
Notation) is more commonly used for data exchange today.
