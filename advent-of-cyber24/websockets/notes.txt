# Websockets (Day 13)

-Websockets: allow your browser and the server to keep a constant line of
communication open. Once the initial handshake is finished and the connection
is established, it remains open. This is faster, but also less secure. Unlike 
HTTPS, Websockets don't have built-in ways to handle authentication or session
validation.

-Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH): an attacker tricks a user's browser
into opening a websocket connection to another site. If successful, the
attacker might be able to hijack that connection or access data meant for the
legitimate server.

-DoS: because websocket connections stay open, they can be targeted by DoS
attacks. An attacker could flood the server with a ton of messages,
potentially slowing it down or crashing it altogether.

-Websocket Message Manipulation: an attacker intercepts and changes the
messages sent between a webapp and its server. A hacker could intercept and
tweak the messages as they're being sent, making the app behave differently
or even embedding malicious code in the data. Websockets don't have end-to-end
encryption like HTTPS does.
