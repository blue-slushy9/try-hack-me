# ADVENT OF CYBER 2024
# LOG ANALYSIS 2

-ELK, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana: log management and analysis tools or SIEMs.

-Kibana Query Language (KQL): used to search documents for values, similar to SQL or Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL). Kibana also allows Lucene query.

-Lucene: advanced language that supports features such as fuzzy terms, regex, etc.

# FILE UPLOAD VULNERABILITIES

-RCE: upload a script written by the attacker that the server runs. 

-XSS: upload an HTML file that contains an XSS code which will steal a cookie 
and send it back to the attacker's server.

-Crafted image file that triggers a vulnerability when processed by the server.

Web shell: script that attackers upload to be able to run shell commands on a 
server, they can access this shell just by browsing to it directly using a 
browser. The attacker may even be able to establish a reverse shell to establish
a direct connection back to their system, which would allow them to control the
server remotely.
